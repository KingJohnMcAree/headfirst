# Copilot Chat Archive

This folder stores exported/archived conversations with Copilot so they persist with your repository and are easy to revisit.

## Recommended workflow
1. After a productive session, open the Copilot Chat panel
2. Click the menu (…): Export conversation or copy all
3. Paste into a dated Markdown file in this folder (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD.md`)
4. Add a short summary and any decisions/TODOs at the top
5. Commit the file so it’s saved with the code

## Naming scheme
- Use ISO date: `YYYY-MM-DD.md` (e.g., `2025-10-31.md`)
- Optionally add a suffix for multiple sessions in a day: `2025-10-31-2.md`

## Tips
- Keep a rolling index in `index.md` if you make lots of sessions
- Redact any secrets or tokens before committing
- Consider linking sessions to PRs/issues for traceability
